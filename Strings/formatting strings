Examples

# ${:.2f} stands for 2 decimal after.  f stands for FLOAT
- price = 7.5
- with_tax = price * 1.09
- print(price, with_tax)
- print("Base price: ${:.2f}. With Tax: ${:.2f}".format(price, with_tax))

# In these two expressions we're using the greater than operator to align text to the right so that the 
output is neatly aligned. In the first expression we're saying we want the numbers to be aligned to the right 
for a total of three spaces. In the second expression we're saying we want the number to always have exactly 
two decimal places and we want to align it to the right at six spaces.

- def to_celsius(x):
  - return(x-32)*5/9
- for x in range(0,101,10):
  - print("{:>3} F | {:>6.2f} C".format(x, to_celsius(x)))

    - {:>3} - numbers to be aligned to the right for a total of three spaces
    - {:>6.2f} - the number to always have exactly two decimal places and we want to align it to the right at six spaces
