#Conditionals Cheat Sheet
In earlier videos, we took a look at some of the built-in Python operators that allow us to compare values, and some logical operators we can use to combine values. We also learned how to use operators in if-else-elif blocks. 

Itâ€™s a lot to learn but, with practice, it gets easier to remember it all. In the meantime, this handy cheat sheet gives you all the information you need at a glance. 

Comparison operators
a == b: a is equal to b
a != b: a is different than b
a < b: a is smaller than b
a <= b: a is smaller or equal to b
a > b: a is bigger than b
a >= b: a is bigger or equal to b
Logical operators
a and b: True if both a and b are True. False otherwise.
a or b: True if either a or b or both are True. False if both are False.
not a: True if a is False, False if a is True.
