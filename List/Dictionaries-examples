Print a line for each item of clothing with each color, for example: "red shirt", "blue shirt", and so on.

- wardrobe = {"shirt":["red","blue","white"], "jeans":["blue","black"]}
- for cloth_type in wardrobe:
	- for color in wardrobe[cloth_type]:
		- print("{} {}".format(color, cloth_type))
    
    
 - return a dictionary with the users as keys and a list of their groups as values.
 def groups_per_user(group_dictionary):
	user_groups = {}
	# Go through group_dictionary
	for group, users in group_dictionary.items():
		# Now go through the users in the group
		for user in users:
		  if user not in user_groups:
		    user_groups[user] = []
		  user_groups[user].append(group)
			# Now add the group to the the list of
      # groups for this user, creating the entry
      # in the dictionary if necessary
      
	return(user_groups)

print(groups_per_user({"local": ["admin", "userA"],
		"public":  ["admin", "userB"],
		"administrator": ["admin"] }))
    


- generate a list that contains complete email addresses (e.g. diana.prince@gmail.com).
def email_list(domains):
	emails = []
	for domain, users in domains.items():
	  for user in users:
	    emails.append(user+"@"+domain)
	return(emails)

print(email_list({"gmail.com": ["clark.kent", "diana.prince", "peter.parker"], "yahoo.com": ["barbara.gordon", "jean.grey"], "hotmail.com": ["bruce.wayne"]}))
